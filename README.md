# Introduction
we can call it "PIC copy of Arduino". it was designed for educational purposes as I study microcontrollers this semester and the main microcontroller in this course is PIC16F877A.
this board supplies me with the most needed connections for me so allow me to mention them to you

# Features
1. 5x10 cm^2
2. ON/OFF Switch
3. Power input (7:20)v in 4 ways (terminal Block, USB, Power Adapter, Vin pin)
4. Outputs 5v, 3.3v
5. Header for all PIC GPIO pins
6. Programming pins header
7. UART communication using CH340 with jumpers to allow either connecting or disconnecting computer communication

# Versions
this is the 4th version of this board as I always seek additional improvements that will help me make the work easier
- 1st Version was only the main connection of the reset circuit and crystal
- 2nd version supported input power (7:20)v through terminal block
- 3rd version supported the dc jack and added some protection to the power circuit
- 4th and last version includes the features mentioned above
